Toothless Roaster 🦷🔥
This is a Flask application I created for a friend who had their teeth pulled out by a dentist. Because if life knocks out your teeth, the least you can do is laugh about it.

What It Does
Fetches a dad joke from Reddit every 3 seconds and displays it on the HTML page.

Includes an "Another Joke" button to manually fetch a fresh joke from Reddit whenever you need another hit of humor.

Perfect for keeping your spirits up while your dentist bills keep you down.

Warning: This app may cause excessive laughter. Side effects include sore ribs and the inability to chew anything for unrelated reasons.

Enjoy the jokes, and embrace that glorious gap! 😁
